# Oh God Not Another Framework (OGNAF)

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

OGNAF is a tiny clientside framework that's build on the Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle.  
It functions as an ice-breaker to start using the power of web components and the native tools of the browser.

# why
* [Extremely small - Less than 1kb minified and gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@ognaf/core@0.1.9)
* Agnostic - Can be used with any client.
* No dependencies - Which means less maintenence.
* Modular - By using shadow DOM and applying styling inside the component, each element can be isolated.
* Extendable - You can add your own methods and data by extending the classes.
